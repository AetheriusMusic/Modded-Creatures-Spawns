# MODDED CREATURES SPAWNS

### This is a Rain World mod that adds modded creatures spawns into **Vanilla** and **Downpour** regions (not Watcher ones).

Instead of modifying existing dens, the mod adds new dens to pre-existing rooms, so that it can be compatible with any mod.

# INSTALLATION

You can download the mod through the [Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3542357472), but if for some reason you are downloading it via GitHub and not on via Steam, you need to put the `moddedcreaturesspawns` folder inside `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods`, assuming you have Rain World installed via Steam, and you're also going to need to download the dependencies for the mod (which can be downloaded automatically if you download the mod via Steam's Workshop)
